# Image-Classifier-using-ResNet-18

I have created an Image classifier using Resnet-18 with help of FastAI libraries, that allow you to use pre-trained models.
List and details of models can be found on fast.ai website.
I have build the image classifier that trains the model for 4 classes.
1. Dogs
2. Cats
3. Forests
4. Birds


At the end, i also found the probability to check model accuracy which shows 100% accurate results.
